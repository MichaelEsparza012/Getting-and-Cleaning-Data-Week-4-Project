# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 peer graded project.
# Executive Summary
This GitHub Repository was created in order to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Peer Graded project.

General.  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Objective.  Prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Specified Tasks.  The following tasks are required to be addresed:

a. Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following (for the R Script, pleaase see file: run_analysis.R).

(1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

(2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

(3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

(4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

(5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#  Reference Data Frames/Sets
